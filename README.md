# GO - Repuation bot

A reputation bot for telegram that I'm building while learning Go Lang

Note: Currently there is no way to detect update of reactions in a message, so the reputation will be contabilized based on replys to a message with `+1, -1` or some emojis

Features
 - [ ] Track user reputation for chats
 - [ ] Global user reputation (the reputation of a user accumulative for all chats)
 - [ ] Lead board
